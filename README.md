**Tutorial for loading the MAD-EEG dataset**, a research corpus for studying EEG-based auditory attention decoding to a target instrument in polyphonic music that can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4537751#.YS5MOI4zYuU)

The dataset consists of 20-channel EEG responses to music recorded from 8 subjects while attending to a particular instrument in a music mixture. For further details, please refer to the paper [MAD-EEG: an EEG dataset for decoding auditory attention to a target instrument in polyphonic music](https://telecom-paris.hal.science/hal-02291882v1).
